# ðŸ›’ SQL Store Database Project

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a relational database for a fictional online store using SQL. It showcases how core business operationsâ€”such as customer tracking, product management, order processing, inventory control, and product reviewsâ€”can be modeled through a robust schema and queried efficiently.

## ðŸ§± Database Structure

The system includes five primary entities:

- **Customers**: Stores personal details, contact information, and addresses.
- **Products**: Includes product name, category, price, and manufacturer.
- **Orders**: Tracks order details, quantities, and total pricing.
- **Inventory**: Monitors available stock and storage location.
- **Reviews**: Captures customer feedback and star ratings.

All tables are normalized to reduce redundancy and maintain integrity, with clear primary and foreign key relationships. The schema was visualized through an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD).

## ðŸ§ª Features & SQL Logic

- ERD-driven schema creation
- Unique constraints for email and phone number fields
- Join operations across multiple tables
- Views such as average product ratings and customer spending
- Data types and constraints optimized for consistency
